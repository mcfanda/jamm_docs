`r keywords("Mediation, simple mediation")`

This example shows how to estimate a simple mediation model with three variables in jAMM. Data come from [University of Virginia Research Data Service]('http://static.lib.virginia.edu/statlab/materials/data/mediationData.csv') and contain variables related to school achievement in a sample of students. There are three variables, school `grades`, `self-esteem`, and `happiness`, measured on quantitative scales (I renamed the variables to make the data more intuitive, with `X=grades`, `M=selfesteem` and `Y=happiness`. We also defined the variables as continuous in the data tab). The mediation model, explained [here](https://data.library.virginia.edu/introduction-to-mediation-analysis/), is a classical simple mediation, as shown in the Figure.

# jAMM

First, we launch the module under `linear models` menu. You can see in the results panel (right) that a simple mediation model path diagram is ready to be filled by selecting variables (left).

# Input

In case of simple mediation, we simply need to define the role of the variables. So, we put `happiness` in the `Dependent Variable` field, `selfesteem` in the `Mediators` field, and `grades` in the `Covariates` (continuous independent variables) field.

When you define the variables role, the module understands the mediation model and updates the path diagram.

# The model

In case of simple mediation, the module understands the intended statistical model, that can be checked in the `Mediators models` and `Full model` tabs.

The tabs simply indicate that the mediation model is composed by a linear regression with `selfesteem` as dependent and `grades` as independent, and one regression with `happiness` as dependent and `selfesteem` and `grades` as independent variables. These two models are also reported in the `Model info` result table.

In the `Model info` table you can also see how the module deduced what is the mediated effect to be computed, in our example `grades -> selfesteem -> happiness`.

In the mediation literature notation, these models are usually referred to as:

$$ M =k_1 + a \cdot X $$

$$ Y =k_2+ b \cdot M +  c^\prime \cdot X$$
($k_i$  are intercepts)

# Results

Results report indirect (mediated), direct (unmediated) and total effects, under the `Mediation` section, in the `Indirect and direct effects`.

<img src="examples/virginia_simple/results1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

The `Indirect` row reports the _mediated effect_. Thus, this is the classical $a \cdot b$ mediation effect, where $a$ is the coefficient from `grades` to `selfesteem` and $b$ is the coefficient from `selfesteem` to `happiness`, keeping constant `grades`. Coefficients $a$ and $b$ are the components of the mediated effect, and you can see them in the table in the `Component` rows. As expected, $a \cdot b= .5610 \cdot .6355 = .3565$. 

The `z` test associated with the mediated effect is the _large sample_ z test of the mediated effect, which is a slightly more accurate version of the Sobel test. The confidence intervals are also computed using _large sample_ approximation, but the bootstrap version of confidence intervals can be asked in the `Mediation options` tab (see below).

The `Direct` row shows the effect of the independent variable not mediated by `selfesteem`, the coefficient usually denoted by $c^\prime$ in the mediation jargon. The `Total` effect is the overall effect of `grades` on `hapiness`, that is $c=a \cdot b + c^\prime$. All the `z` tests associated with these coefficients test the null-hypothesis that the corresponding coefficient is zero. Confidence intervals are computed with the same method used for the indirect effect.

Finally, the $\beta$ column shows the standardized solution coefficients.

# Confidence intervals

By default, the jAMM computes the confidence intervals using the _large sample_ delta method, that is using the z test as the starting point of computation. However, often users prefer to use a bootstrap method. That can be done in the  `Mediation options` tab.

Several bootstrap methods can be selected. One of the most used in mediation analysis is the _precentile_ method, which is jAMM is called `bootstrap (Percent)`. See `r link_pages(nickname="glm_help")` for help on the other options. Please note that the bootstrap method can be very time-consuming and slow.

To recap, to estimate a simple mediation model, simply select the dependent, the independent, and the mediator variable, and the results will be shown in the results table.
